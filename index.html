        <p> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, (a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as: Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example Client-side JavaScript and Server-side JavaScript.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>Variables use symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables (identifiers) conform to certain rules.</p>
        <code>var x = 42.</code>
        <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
        <code>let y = 13.</code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
        <header>Constants</header>
        <p>The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
        <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
        <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope.</p>
        <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
"otherValue";</code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
        <header>Data Types</header>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:

Six data types that are primitives:
<ul>

<li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
<li>ull. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
<li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
<li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
<li>String. "Howdy"</li>
<li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
</ul>
And the other excluded data type is  Object.

</p>
        <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="While_Statements">
        <header>While Statements</header>
        <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true</p>
        <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. </p>
